## About The Project
Tried to update my earlier ecommerce project with some of the features such as payment option and login optiion. And now trying to learn and test the payment gateway.  

## How This Benefit Me?
I am able to learn both front end and back end while working around this and as a beginner at times I felt difficulty but the interest made me to finish the work. Helps to know more about the Admin Interface.  It's very intersting to know how the database works and how non user can also modify the database with authorisation.
As work progress I was very happy and this was the project I loved most as I am able to do lot MY OWN things!!! I am able to learn more about the admin nterface and how to modify the database using SQL

## What To Improve?
Learned to integrate razorpay payment to the website, but there is  room for improvement, sometimes payment window fails.
